"crafting recipes" with different types
- Harvesting for materials
- Refining for ores and ingots and power and shiz
- Power generation and machinery
- After MAX upgrade on harvesting, start other techniques
    - Start being able to build machines to "replicate" things more efficiently
    - After that, start "summoning" items through macic
    - ...

- harvestable can only be farmed by tool with mining level >= 
- better tools have better mining power, therefore going against the toughness value (subtractive)
- mining power will not be applied to items with the exact same mining level
- if toughness ends up negative, substract from the next cycle and so on (one click could harvest multiple)

- whenever upgrade is applied, have a global function check unlock requirements for resources and stuff
